ABOUT THIS BLOG 
---

Welcome to my blog! I'm going to write some posts about my main interest here: machine learning research.

Sometimes I release my code, I love to share things and discuss. 

ABOUT ME

My name is Iacopo, I got a Master degree in <a href="http://areeweb.polito.it/didattica/pcs/" target="_blank">
Physics of Complex Systems</a> in October 2017. I currently live in Paris and work as R&D machine learning engineer in
the startup <a href="http://lighton.io" target="_blank">LightOn</a>, where I did my final project for the Master.
