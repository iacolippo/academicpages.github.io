ABOUT THIS BLOG 
---

Welcome to my blog! If you like Deep Learning and Computer Science, you'll like it here.
I'm going to write posts about my research, my projects and things I try in my free time, 
mostly on deep learning, but also on general machine learning.

I try to release my code, so that you can replicate what I'm doing =) I'm still 
learning, but I love to share things and discuss them with people. 

This blog is mainly inspired by my internship supervisor at 
<a hef="http://www.lighton.io">LightOn</a> (check it, we use light to build the future of 
computing!). He's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igorcarron/">Igor Carron</a> and he 
has a <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.fr">supercool blog</a> you should definitely 
check out if you're into **compressive sensing**, **advanced matrix factorization techniques** 
or **machine learning**.

ABOUT ME
---

My name is Iacopo, I'm a Master student in <a href="http://areeweb.polito.it/didattica/pcs/">
Physics of Complex Systems</a>. I took my B.Sc. in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. 
During my studies I always tried to learn other things on the side, mostly computer 
science related: I taught myself HTML, CSS, a little bit of Javascript, a lot of Python 
and a bunch of other things. In general, if it's something that runs on a computer, I'm 
probably going to like it.
Right now, I'm really interested in Deep Learning. It's difficult not to be, in a time where 
outstanding results are coming out everyday. This lack of theory that makes it look like
magic is even more appealing to me. It's a *hacking things* approach, and that's what I
like!

I currently live in Paris, but I've lived in Brescia (my home city), Turin (my favorite city
in Italy) and Trieste too. I will probably live elsewhere in a few months... The world is big!

You can use the social links on the left to follow me on Twitter and Github, to connect
with me on Linkedin or to see my Q&A on Stackoverflow!

Hope you'll have a good time here!
